#Zmanager

This is a repository containing the files of the Zmanager project.

What is Zmanager ? 
  - Zmanager is an highschool website project which runs thanks to Django and Mysql.

Is it useful ? 
  - Probably not as i will not provide any update after the end of the project date.

Can i use it for my Zoo ? 
  - No, it will lead to big security concerns if you try to use this education oriented project as a real professional tool

If i am not a Zoo employee, how to use it ?
  - 
Did you use AI to code the project ? 
  - I am quite sceptic about AI, however i think programmation is a great tool which leads to wonderful projects. AI can be used as long as the developper understands fully what he is doing
    personally i used ChatGPT to plan the project infrastructure, but all HTML files were handwritten (on paper literally, yes), the "production" server was deployed with Portainer aswell.

What are the goals of this project ? 
  - This project was made to obtain a good grade in the NSI subject (Computer science in French schools), however judging by the efficiency of our team i don't think we'll get more than 10/20.

What grade did you get for the project and how did the presentation go ? 
  - This will be answered on 12/13/2025 (Remind me later)

Was it difficult to deploy ?
  - Of course, but positivity and motivation helps with the difficulty of starting the project, don't hesitate with name, appearance etc... at first, just make something and later you'll find inspiration

Will you maker other projects ? 
  - Yes when i'll have free time.

Goodbye ? 
  - Goodbye, see you soon
